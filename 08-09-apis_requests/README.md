# API PAGE LAB - Coding Nomads JavaScript 101
# Time and Location Data using User IP Address

## Description

The purpose of this lab is to use a series of API's to retrieve data and then display this information on a single webpage. 

### Required Information (Features of Project)

#### Use of current user's IP Address to find current location and display:
- Country 
- Country Code
- Region
- Region Bloc
- City 
- Latitude and Longitude
- Population Number of Country
- Languages spoken in country 
- Current Time
- Timezone
- Sunrise, Sunset and Length of Day
- Display the flag of the current location country
- Change background colors dependent on the time of day (sunrise, day, sunset and night)

#### The webpage needed to also display information about the ISS:
- Time of next ISS flyover
- Number of People currently in space

**Note on ISS Features:**
The Lab Brief supplied an API for the ISS Information as:
http://open-notify.org.

However this API (at the time of project creation and writing of this README) has disabled the feature to retrieve the time and date of the ISS Flyovers. Other API's were checked but none were found to provide this information. An alternative would be to perform the calculations manually, however these were incredibly complicated and deemed to not meet lab requirements as the goal was to retrieve information with the use of APIs; not perform the calculations at that scale ourselves

#### Alternative to ISS Flyover Times:
- Latitude and Longitude of current ISS Location
- Name of country (or body of water (non specific)) that ISS is currently over

### Personal Additions and Goals:
The structure and layout of the webpage was not specified by the lab brief. It was decided to model the webpage as a modern smartwatch as this is a creative manner in which to display the required features whilst maintaining a familiar style for a user to easily read the information

An additional feature to display the battery level was also added

## Features and Visuals

The features described in the above description have all been implemented in the webpage and are described in more detail here
