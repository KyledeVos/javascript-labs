# Meeting 1
## Date: 9 August 2022
Time: 10:45 - 11:20

Duration 35 minutes

## Meeting Goal and Summary:
This first meeting was to speak to the client to achieve an understanding of her vision and requirements for her store website: craftsbymicks. However in discussion Michaela decided it would be better for her to instead have a website that acted as a Personal Business Management Tool tailored to her specifications.

## Meeting Information

The client (Michaela) already has a website for her Resin Product Business, however it has beeen designed using a template website and often limits the features she can add or have. Our initial goal was to recreate a personal website for her that better suited the features she would have liked to have and give her more control over her website. Her initial thoughts included:

- A feature to add videos as the current website only allows images
- To move the links for Facebook, TikTok and Instagram to the top of the page and add additonal links for Gmail and Canvas

At this point Michaela decided she would rather have a Personal Management Tool as she is currrently using a series of Excel documents to track all of her business and product information. This is an untidy and labour intensive manner in which to control her business adminstration and she would much rather have a tool with a functional and clean layout to better handle this information 

She wants the layout to mirror that of her current website in terms of majority layout, styles and colours but is very open to other designs as well and wants to be involved and updated as the designs are created and modified accordign to her preferences. The client has been assured that she will be kept in the loop and updated with new design information. Follow Up Meetings will continue regularly.

Michalea has given initial ideas for her website to begin the creation of a prototype of the front page:

- Maintain current styling of webpage available from: https://craftsbymicks.company.site. This includes dark backgrounds and images with white text. Maintain the fonts used taking into account a combination of caligraphy and fonts similar to Times New Roman (subject to change)
- Have Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Gmail and Canvas Links at the top of all pages.
- All pages need to have a search bar and display the company logo at the top. She does not want this header information to remain fixed and must move with the scrolling of the page\

**Feature Buttons**
- New Product : This Button will allow her to add a new type of product to the *database* focusing on the category of item, name, description, products and quantities needed to produce it, cost and selling price, manufacturing time, an image and/or video of the item (may add more properties in later development)
- Make a Product - This button will open a new page in which Michaela will begin the process to make an order. This was not discussed in detail yet as I have asked to see the current excel documents (or a blank sample of them) and her current process to begin to replicate (and possibly improve) on the process
- Current Products - Menu that would show all the current products the client has showing all the details, stock or availability, pricing
- Price Check - A feature very desired by the client to select manufacturing itens and the quantities she would like to use to see an estimate of the price. This feature allows Michaela to use her experience and creativity to determine the cost factors of a product before making the process formal and is VERY important to the client
- Add Ingredients (name may change) - A feature allowing Michaela to add new raw items to her stock used to make her Resin products

## Additional Notes

- The client has specified that she is not a fan of excessively long pages or unnecessary scrolling. She is aware that in the page needed to log orders or view items there may be scrolling needed which is she happy with, as long as it is not excessive.
- Client has also asked that the links to her Facebook, Gmail, Canvas etc need to be readily available to her and does not want to have to move to a previous page to get them especially when she is concentrating on making an order. I have suggested a small side menu button that could move with the page that she could click and it would show her the links she needs without having to go to a different or scroll to the top and break her concentratioon and she wa shappy with this option
- Client has also emphasized that she wants the page to have a 'clean' look and not be covered in information 

## Conclusion

Client has been assured that her preferences are very important and will be used in all instances of design and functionality to her website. It will be hosted locally on her machine as she wants to have sole access to it. A Basic means of logging in may be added, however this is not a true means of secutity. I want to ensure the webiste can be interacted with by the client with minimal need for the developer to have to assist her in adding products, etc. User-Friendliness is a MAJOR priority for this website 

It has also been decided that the website will not run using a sepertate database. This project is mainly a simple management tool designed by a student of JavaScript and should not yet have extra features truly external to this course (within reason of course). Further Development of this project will consider factors of:
- A Database
- Major focus on security 
- Linking this website to her current one or possibly creating a second, product website for the client
- Potentially creating a cellphone app of this website
