# Progress Update to Michaela - 10 August 2022

Michaela was very happy with the initial design of the front page and included every element that was discussed in the first meeting. Links 
connecting the front page of her productivity website to her Social Media and Gmail pages were demonstrated to work correctly. Client was happy with the layout
and colors chosen ensuring the page maintains a 'clean-look' as requested

## Plan Forward to Client

The next step for the project will include the creation of 5 additonal HTML Pages each housing the productivity features requested:
- New Product
- New Order
- Current Products
- Price Check
- New Materials

These pages must all have:
- Similar stylings and colors to the front page
- Social Media Links, Search Bar and Company Logo and Name must appear at the top of all pages and be identical to the front page
- A fixed button on the side of the screen allowing Michaela to use links to her Social Media and Gmail without needing to go to another page or scroll to the top of the existing page

Michalea has also been notified that a database or text files will be needed, and that developent and research of these options will begin today

## Tasks

- Create 5 HTML Feature Pages
- Ensure front page correctly links to these pages
- Begin research and implementation of either a databse or text files to store data
- Begin work on Stylings of pages. As all of Michaela's products require materials to be made and priced, work will begin first on feature "New Materials"
